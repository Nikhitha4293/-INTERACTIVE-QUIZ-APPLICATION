ðŸ”¹ Description
The quiz application is a simple interactive web app designed to test user knowledge in real-time. The interface loads a set of multiple-choice questions one by one. When the user selects an answer, they immediately receive feedback on whether it was correct or not, and their score is updated accordingly.

The app leverages JavaScript for logic, question progression, answer validation, and score tracking. HTML is used for structuring the quiz interfaceâ€”question box, options, buttonsâ€”while CSS ensures itâ€™s visually appealing with responsive design. This task helps interns understand DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic UI updates, crucial for real-world frontend development.

The app can be enhanced by adding features like question timers, progress bars, or storing scores locally.
